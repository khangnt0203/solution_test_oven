### Guideline
- Read the description carefully when you start to test
- How much time it took to complete or before stopping
- Your feelings about the test
- What the lacking in the task definition
- Is the solution complete or not? Is the solution optimized or is it via brute force?
- Be sure that your code is readable and well commented or that the naming is semantic

### Answer:
1) I was stopped within 55 minutes.
2) I am very interested by this test. 
Before doing code, when reading the description, I was surprised that I would code by Typescript. I spent a day going through the Typescript document in Turtorial. After that, I started testing in the time allowed.
3) Finally, my solution is complete for all task but I guess my code is not the best solution, in the short time and don't have much expereince on the proper code, I was code as well as I could. I hope the work I done will keep the problem to a minimum.
